# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System-for-Classrooms
This code is used for my college project of Attendance system using Face-Recognition and OpenCV library of Python 3.9.5.
The code skeleton and outline is used from this [video](https://youtu.be/uwJltCOrpEI) and edited the code for necessory changes to make it run properly. 
The face-recognition library and dlib can be installed as in following [video](https://youtu.be/BkTFzjFKQQU).

# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System-for-Classrooms
This code is used for my college project of Attendance system using Face-Recognition and OpenCV library of Python 3.9.5.
The code skeleton and outline is used from this [video](https://youtu.be/uwJltCOrpEI) and edited the code for necessory changes to make it run properly. 
The face-recognition library and dlib can be installed as in following [video](https://youtu.be/BkTFzjFKQQU) for Windows. For Ubuntu Linux follow [this](https://kumarvinay.com/installing-dlib-library-in-ubuntu/) for dlib installation and [this](https://kumarvinay.com/face-recognition-with-dlib-on-ubuntu-18-04/) for face_recognition library. Thanks for your time.
